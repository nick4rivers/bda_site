          <p>The use of structures designed to mimmic the form and function of natural beaver dams is increasingly being applied to the restoration of wetland environments throughout Oregon. Often referred to as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261215514_Using_Beaver_Dams_to_Restore_Incised_Stream_Ecosystems">Beaver Dam Analogs</a>, these structures take a variety of forms, and can be used to encourage a variety of biological, hydrologic, and geomorphic processes as part of riparian and channel enhancement projects.

          <h4>BDA Explorer</h4>
          <p>The BDA Explorer site was set up to encourage communication among restoration practitioners using beaver dam analog (BDA) type restoration techniques. The site allows users to enter basic project information making it available to visitors of the site. As more projects are added the site will act as a database of beaver based restoration projects in OR, and will ideally be used to track project outcomes</p>
